# Mushroom-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes
This project demonstrates mushroom classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The goal of this project is to classify mushrooms into edible or poisonous categories based on their physical characteristics. Naive Bayes is a popular machine learning algorithm that is well-suited for this task because it can handle a large number of features and is able to handle missing data.
